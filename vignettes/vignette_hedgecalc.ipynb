    "# CurrencyHedgeCalculator\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MoneyMarketHedgeCalculator** is a Python package to manage foreign exchange transaction exposure using **money market hedging**. It leverages real-time data from exchange rate and interest rate APIs to calculate hedging strategies for foreign currency **Accounts Payable (AP)** and **Accounts Receivable (AR)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users can input transaction parameters, including **money amount**, **domestic country name**, **foreign country name**, and the package provides clear calculations and steps to construct a money market hedge decision, inclduing values like present value of transactions, necessary borrowing or investment amounts, and effective forward rates. This package simplifies hedging decisions, ensuring cost predictability and reducing the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fetches real-time **spot exchange rates** and **interest rates**.\n",
    "2. Calculates hedging strategies for:\n",
    "   - **Accounts Payable**: Borrowing in domestic currency.\n",
    "   - **Accounts Receivable**: Borrowing in foreign currency.\n",
    "3. Outputs key financial data and effective forward rates.\n",
    "4. Generates combined reports for both AP and AR.\n",
